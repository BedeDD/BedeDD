<p>
    This blog serves as my public notebook where I document helpful insights, useful code patterns, and 'aha!' moments from my daily work as a developer.
</p>

<p>
    Like many developers, I find that writing about what I learn helps solidify my understanding and creates a valuable reference for future me.<br>
    My posts often explore Ruby and Rails ecosystems, domain modeling approaches, and general software craftsmanship.
</p>


<p>
    Every post represents something I learned or found interesting enough to document.<br>While some entries might be basic and others complex, they all reflect authentic learning moments from my journey as a developer.<br>
    Feel free to explore and learn alongside me.
