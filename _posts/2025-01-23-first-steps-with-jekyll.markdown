# Jekyll - heard it numerous times, never used it

As a Ruby developer, I've always heard about Jekyll in the Rails community, but somehow never got around to trying it. Recently, I decided to take the plunge and set up my own blog using Jekyll, and I wanted to share my first impressions.

The setup process was surprisingly straightforward. If you're familiar with Ruby gems and bundler, you'll feel right at home. It's essentially `gem install jekyll bundler` and you're most of the way there. The initial scaffolding reminds me of `rails new` - you get a simple project structure for a fresh start.

The syntax for creating posts and pages took a little getting used to, but it's not complex. If you've worked with Ruby's ERB templates, Jekyll's Liquid templating will feel familiar, just with slightly different syntax. The frontmatter (the YAML at the top of each post) is clean and intuitive - it's like defining attributes for a Ruby class, but in your content files.

One thing that really stood out was Jekyll's documentation. Coming from the Rails world, I appreciate good docs, and Jekyll doesn't disappoint.

The plugin ecosystem is robust - there's a Jekyll plugin for almost anything you might want to do. Whether it's SEO optimization, generating sitemaps, or handling redirects, chances are someone has already built what you need. It reminds me of the Rails ecosystem in that sense.

I actually had fun during the initial setup, experimenting with different themes and tweaking the configuration. A huge shoutout to Superails ([Episode 221](https://superails.com/posts/you-don-t-have-a-blog-are-you-even-a-web-developer-create-a-blog-with-jekyll-221)) for their excellent tutorial that got me started. If you're familiar with their Rails content, you know they make complex concepts approachable, and their Jekyll guide is no exception.

Overall, Jekyll strikes a nice balance between simplicity and flexibility. It's a static site generator that feels very Ruby-ish in its conventions and approach, which made the learning curve much gentler than I expected.
